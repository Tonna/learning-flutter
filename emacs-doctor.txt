I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

A: I want to copy flutter table, but the imports I cannot easily handle

Is it because the imports you cannot easily handle that you came to
me?

A: why cannot I use non-nullable dart language feature? I have dart
2.11.0-something.dev ?


Is it because cannot you use non nullable dart language feature you
have dart 2 11 0 something dev that you came to me?

A: Why does updating flutter and dart takes so long? It downloads
things all the time. It's because I don't know what am I doing.


Does it bother you that you do not know what are you doing?

A: I don't think that simply putting different number of cells in each
row I can get anywhere. Lets see if I can merge cells 

When did you first know that simply putting different number of cells
in each row you can get anywhere lets see if you can merge cells?

A: If I wan't to "merge" two cells, should I don't render second cell
and render first cell on place of second?

Why do you say that?

A: I cannot set value in debug

Earlier you said cannot you use non nullable dart language feature you
have dart 2 11 0 something dev?

A: I think it is not supported 
https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/unable-to-set-value-of-variable-in-debugger/7267/2

Maybe your life has something to do with this.

A:How do I get size of several children (ex. two in a row) and combine them?

Is the fact that do you get size of several children ex two in a row
and combine them the real reason?

A: Borders and cell content are drawn separately. Good to know.

I don't understand.

A: Outer border and lines between cells are drawn separately.

You mentioned that you do not know what are you doing?

A: So if I'll draw a border of each cell separately, will this help me
draw merged cell?

Perhaps your plans have something to do with this.

A: How to get size of each child?

Does the fact that to get size of each child explain anything else?

A: Merged cells somehow should be treated as a single
cell. i.e. getting width and height for each single individual merged
cell should return common height and width. How to do it? Have some
kind of aggregate object/widget?

Are you sure to do it have some kind of aggregate object widget?

If I'm writing widget for others what API should I provide?

Why do you say that?

How should table be rendered? Should it be vertical/horizontal first
or in some recursive way?

What do you think?

A: I'm creating new widget that is a child of the RenderObjectWidget
(chose it as first thing to come into my mind). Now
I need to implement createElement() and createRenderObject(). 


Is it because is a child of the renderobjectwidget chose it as first
thing to come into your mind now you need to implement createelement
and createrenderobject that you came to me?

Ok. Dart does return null from function implicitly.

I had to implement perform layout in RenderBox

2020-11-13

RenderMyWidget implements RenderShiftedBox now. RenderShiftedBox has constructor with child. So I need to pass child then? Actually all implementations of RenderShiftedBox I saw aren't passing child :)

I don't understand what to do next.
Ok maybe     return _RenderMyWidget(_child.createElement().renderObject); is better than return _RenderMyWidget(null);

Where should I start? What should I do? Lets draw border for widget and child first

Lets make a step back. Removing RenderShifterBox. Just add child and paint borders

There is a connection between widget type (parent type and element type returned in createElement?


/// Defers the layout of its single child to a delegate.
///
/// The delegate can determine the layout constraints for the child and can
/// decide where to position the child. The delegate can also determine the size
/// of the parent, but the size of the parent cannot depend on the size of the
/// child.
class RenderCustomSingleChildLayoutBox

This is not what we want? We want size of the parent to depend on the size of the child

Lets inherit SingleChildRenderObjectWidget, SingleChildRenderObjectElement, RenderCustomSingleChildLayoutBox

for RenderCustomSingleChildLayoutBox we need SingeChildLayoutDelegate


is there a way to get child/children of Widget from RenderObject? how can we get those children, should we pass them on RenderObject create?

Lets see how renderOpacity works
where did it get the child? we aren't setting it, do we?

[[file:./images/screenshot-03.png]]

we take child for RenderObject from widget apparently
and rebuild() is called

ok, now I understand that in parent performLayout() SingeChildLayoutDelegate chould be called to get constaints for the child. I hope I'm not mistaken.

Lets draw the borders though

why doesn't method performLayout() called in my RenderObject ?
my renderObject extends RenderCustomSingleChildLayoutBox. Why performLayout isn't called or I cannot see it?

I have height infinity.
I'm getting some errors, I wasn't noticing before - _getSize(constraints)
[[file:./images/screenshot-04.png]]

haven't implemented getSize in delegate actually.
making size*3 times the size delegate returned

Paint the borders at last


Why doesn't my renderObject has child renderObject?

because I'm not setting child in mount method in element

and I don't return _child from widget - no getter

how to set constraints to a RenderParagraph?

I needed just to call layout and that is it.
